This project aims to read the temp from two thermistors, one monitoring the meat
and one monitoring the grill, use mqtt to push it to
adafruit.io, then use a IFFFT.com recipe to push a notification to the users phone
when the meat temp exceeds a preset value. That was probably the worlds longest sentence ever.
